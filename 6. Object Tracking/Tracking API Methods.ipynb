    "+ Boosting Tracking\n",
    " + Based off AdaBoost algorithm (the same underlying algorithm that the HAAR Cascade based Face Detector Used).\n",
    " + Evaluation occurs across multiple frames.\n",
    " + Very well known and studied algorithm\n",
    " + Doesn't know when tracking has failed\n",
    " + Much better techniques available!\n",
    "+ MIL Tracker\n",
    " - Multiple Instance Learning\n",
    " - Similar to Boosting, but considers a neighbourhood of points around the current location to create multipl instance\n",
    " - Good performance and doesn't drifts as much as Boosting\n",
    " - Failure to track on object may not be reported back\n",
    " - Can't recover from full obstruction\n",
    "+ KCF Tracker\n",
    " + Kernelized Correlation Filters\n",
    " + Exploits some properties of the MIL tracker and the fact that many data points will overlap, leading to more accurate and faster tracking.\n",
    "  + Better than MIL and Boosint \n",
    "  + Great first choice\n",
    "  + Can not recover from full obstruction of object\n",
    "\n",
    "+ TLD Tracker\n",
    " + Tracking, learning, and detection\n",
    " + The tracker follows the object from frame to frame\n",
    " + The detector localizes all appearances that have been observed so far and corrects the tracker if necessary\n",
    " + The learning estimates detector's errors and updates it to avoid these errors in the future.\n",
    " + Good at tracking even with obstruction in frames\n",
    " + Tracks well under large changes in scale\n",
    " + Can provide many false positives\n",
    "+ MedianFlow Trackr\n",
    " + Internally, this tracker tracks the object in both forward and backward directions in time and measures the discrepancies between these two trajectories.\n",
    " + Very good at reporting failed tracking.\n",
    " + Works well with predictable motion.\n",
    " + Fails under large motion (fast moving objects)"
